# Weather-App

This JavaScript code fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API based on user input. 
It listens for a button click or "Enter" key press, sends a request to the API with the entered city name, and updates the UI with temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an appropriate weather icon. 
If the city is not found, it displays an error message.
